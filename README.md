# **PyBer Analysis**

## **Overview**

### Purpose
To analyze the ride share data of PyBer, based on the type of city: urban, suburban, and rural. Specifically, the totals for rides, drivers, and fares were calculated, as well as the average per ride and driver, all for each city type on a weekly basis. Once the data was collected then some conclusions could be drawn to help improve PyBer's business operations.

### Results

As we can see from the table above, urban cities generally are top in each category, except average fares per ride and driver. This can easily be explained by supply and demand. Urban areas have a much larger population concentrated in a smaller area, so there are more options for riders to pick from, and they don't have to go as far to get to places. This will bring prices down for rides, which translates to a lower average fare for drivers, even though the overall total for all fares is more.

On the flipside, rural areas have a smaller population and much greater distances to travel between locations. So while there may not be as many drivers or rides happening, those rides are more expensive than their urban counter parts. And in between these are suburban cites that will average out between the two.

As the line chart above shows, rides in all three city types generally follow the same up and down pattern on a weekly basis. 

## **Summary**
As we can see from the data, PyBer has room for improvement. The first option is rural cities could use an increase in drivers. This would lead to more total sales and lower the average price per ride, which in turn would also encourage more riders. In order to attract more drivers, PyBer could offer sign on bonuses or a bonus to be given after a certain amount of rides have been given. 

Another option could be to try and encourage urban city drivers to work more rides further out in the suburban and rural areas. As we can see from the table, there are more urban city drivers than rides given. This heavily dilutes the money a driver could make, which could be incentive enough to broaden their working area. Again, PyBer could give various bonuses to encourage this, such as working a certain amount of rides in cities designated as rural. This option also saves time and money for PyBer as the drivers are already established and working.
