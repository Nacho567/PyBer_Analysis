# **PyBer Analysis**

## **Overview**

### Purpose
To analyze the ride share data based on the type of city: urban, suburban, and rural. Specifically, the totals for rides, drivers, and fares were calculated, as well as the average per ride and driver, all for each city type on a weekly basis. Once the data was collected then some conclusions could be drawn to help improve PyBer's business operations.

### Results

As we can see from the table, urban cities generally are top in each category, except average fares per ride and driver. This can easily be explained by supply and demand. Urban areas generally have a much larger population concentrated in a smaller area, so there are more options for riders to pick from, and they don't have to go as far to get to places. This will bring prices down for rides, which translates to a lower average for drivers, even though the overall total for all rides is more.

On the flipside, rural areas have a smaller population and much greater distances to travel between locations. So while there may not be as many drivers or rides happening, those rides are more expensive than their urban counter parts. And in between these are suburban cites that will fluctuate
